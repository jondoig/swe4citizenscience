[[EnhancedInteroperability]]
== From Data Models to Interoperability Contracts

Goals:

* reduce transaction costs
* improve interoperability between components
* improve ease of use for non-experts
* allow more auto-configuration

=== Current situation in SDIs
aspects such as:

* keywords for discovery unknown
* data models need to be defined
* few profiles directly usable
* no links
* ...


idea: start with data model (done here)
but issue: applied approach is not explicit! Which one to chose, why one and not the other...0


idea: model dimensions in data cubes -> generate surveys against these dimensions


=== Data Cube Approach
Interoperability dimensions:

* geographical dimension
* time
* thematic
* data model
* ...?

=== Future SDI Situation
aspects such as:

* read RDF QB dimensions to understand what vocabularies to query
* query catalog to get the URI template structures for a given vocabulary (or linked data entries?)
* interact with vocabulary to get relationships of query terms and other resources
* data access with content negotiation

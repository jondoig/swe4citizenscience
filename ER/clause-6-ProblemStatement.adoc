== Citizen Science Data Collection and Exchange
Citizen science, the involvement of volunteers in research, has increased the scale of studies in many fields (Crain, Cooper, and Dickinson 2014; Dickinson, Zuckerberg, and Bonter 2010) and the number of citizen science projects is constantly growing. Local, national, and international platforms such as buergerschaffenwissen.de in Germany (Wissenschaft im Dialog gGmbH 2015) or journals such as Scientific American (Scientific American 2015) feature new projects every other months. These projects implement the citizen science approach and explore everything from the sea floor to the stars (ABC Science 2015; Cowing 2014). Though the roots of citizen science reach back many centuries, when most scientists made their living in some other profession, the popularity has recently grown to levels previously unknown, mainly due to the availability of tools and IT platforms that foster simple organization, advertisement, and setup of citizen science sampling campaigns or citizen science work (Wiggins and Crowston 2015; Xue 2014; Johnson 2016). Simultaneously, the role of the citizen scientist has changed. The modern citizen scientist is a volunteer who collects and/or processes data as part of a scientific enquiry (Silvertown 2009), whereas his historic counterpart was engaged in the full spectrum of scientific work, starting with the identification of research questions and all follow up activities. The focus on some selected steps has opened the scientific process to the masses, and therefore an endless number of observations is constantly made by citizen scientists, digitized, and stored in databases around the globe.

These data, though often generated in a very purpose-oriented process, holds an enormous potential if being made available to others for comparison or integration and further processing in other campaigns or research efforts. As an example, air- or noise pollution results sampled in one campaign could provide valuable insights for species sampling campaigns or public health campaigns. In order to exploit this potential, a number of requirements have to be fulfilled. First, the data needs to be made discoverable, means that it has to be annotated with sufficient metadata to allow others to find the data. Second, the data needs to be made available at interfaces that are accessible to others, ideally in a standardized way to allow efficient access to the data of subsets thereof. Third, the data needs to be comprehensible to others, which includes aspects such as available formats, used semantics, or descriptions of the sampling process. It needs to be annotated with privacy and security information to allow adding necessary security layers or reflect applied processing steps, such as quality assurance or anonymization processes.

[[CitizenScienceProcess]]
=== The Citizen Science Process
The citizen science process commonly consists of five steps as illustrated in Figure 1 below. These steps are usually executed sequentially, though include loops and feedback cycles. The first step (left) includes the definition of the sampling campaign itself. The type and nature of the sampling protocol and corresponding observed properties is normally motivated by the survey objectives, but may take additional aspects into consideration such as quality assurance process or publication requirements. Once defined, an (usually) mobile app (survey app) is configured and made available to the citizens to suppot the data collection process. All raw data, i.e. the observation data as provided by citizens, is persistently stored and eventually published. Quality assurance processes work on the raw data and on previously quality assured data, potentially taking external data sets into account. This multi-loop process may result in any number of data sets of various quality or aggregation levels or any number of versions of raw, quality assured, aggregated, or newly derived data sets.

The end of the citizen science process is the publication of the data, which in turn might be the beginning for another process. The publication can include all levels from raw to highly processed data. In the following, the various steps and their possible implications are described using a survey example from the research project Citizen OBservatory WEB (COBWEB, https://cobwebproject.eu)(Higgins et al. 2016).

=== Sampling Campaign
Citizen science sampling campaigns often make use of mobile applications to support the citizen in the data collection process. Figure 2 illustrates such a mobile app that is used in Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica) sampling campaigns. Occurrences of the invasive species Japanese Knotweed are monitored in many places of the world. Japanese Knotweed, native to East Asia, is a large, herbaceous perennial plant of the Polygonaceae family. It is known for its invasive root system and strong growth that can damage concrete foundations, buildings, flood defenses, roads, or sidewalks. It can also reduce the capacity of channels in flood defenses to carry water and accelerate river bank erosion (Bailey 2003).

One of the primary goals during sampling campaign definition is to avoid any ambiguities in the understanding of observed properties, used sensing techniques and hardware, and sampling protocols between survey designers and citizens. Both groups shall share common semantics of all terms used. Though the interaction options with a mass of citizens is limited, and little influence exists to ensure that citizens make themselves familiar with the applied semantics, it is crucial that clear instructions and definitions of all aspects, e.g. observed properties or sensors, are available. As the screen space on mobile devices is limited, it is necessary to provide resolvable links to all observed properties and clear explanations of the sampling protocol and applied sensing hardware. The application shown in Figure 2 illustrates this aspect using the observed properties as an example. Though “Plant height” is probably easy to understand, “Evidence of management” leaves considerably more room for interpretation. There are many aspects related to user interface design that cannot discussed here. Instead, focus is laid on the definition of the semantics, which are not visible to the user.

If all observed properties would be using definitions in the form of simple names, semantics would be limited to the understanding of the survey designer and, given that sufficient descriptive data are provided as part of the mobile app, to the citizens participating in the survey. If instead fully qualified names in the form of resolvable URLs would be used, then the raw data becomes meaningful even to external users that have not used the mobile app but only received the raw data. Labels can still be used for display purposes, as illustrated in Figure 2. The following code snipped illustrates the full concept. It is an excerpt from the HTML5-based form that is used in the application illustrated in figure 2. The citizen does not see any links to the definitions directly, as the style sheets render this form element as shown in Figure 2, but the link to the observed property definition is provided and reveals further information if followed by tapping on the displayed names.
